# React Weather Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). \ \
I created this weather application in order to practice React with a purpose that is useful to other people. In this app, I have used the OpenWorld API, and the GEODB API, in order to create a search component (for people to look up their city of choice), and for the weather + forecast themselves. It was a lot of hard work, and I'm glad with how it turned out!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
